Proven skills in CAE, Design and Advanced materials with hands-on experience in performing set-up and interpretation of FEA analysis for Static/Dynamic, Linear/Non-linear, Crash, Modal, Thermal, and fatigue analysis load cases in commercial software packages like Hyperworks, Ansys. Strong experience with Solidworks and Siemens NX for CAD, and 3D Printing for rapid prototyping applications.\n\n# Currently\n\nAt [DeepOrange 12](https://cuicardeeporange.com/project/deep-orange-12/), I am interning as a Manufacturing Integrator. My work mainly deals with prototyping of the CAD models the CAD engineers generate using 3D printing. I also assist the CAD engineers when it comes to DF<sub>x</sub> (manufacturing/assembly/cost) and CAE. I also handle the material & manufacturing process selection for the said parts. Finally, I have also used my knowledge of 80-20 aluminum rails to design, optimize and build a structure house all the electronic components within their thermal and NVH constraints.\n\n# My Story\n\n- My parents got my first bicycle when I was 3 years old (circa. 1999) and thus began my love for <em>things that move</em>.\n\n- My love for cars came from age 6, when my dad <em>finally</em> got a laptop for the home. It was an old Compaq laptop from his then workplace; but it was something. I still remember playing endless hours of [Need for Speed - Hot Pursuit 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Hot_Pursuit_2) and [Porsche Unleashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Porsche_Unleashed) on it until the game discs literally burned out.\n\n- Moving to elementary school, I always made it a point to disassemble any mechanical pencil that I used to get, only to fail in putting it back together, which resulted in a good scolding at home. But that never deterred my inquisitive nature.\n\n- I took a trip to Singapore in 2004 which was my first and till date favorite international destination. This is where I fell in love with [Pokemon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen) on the Gameboy Advance.\n\n- Ages 8-15 were very busy. Started many activities to see which would stick around long enough to turn into hobbies; none did.\n\n- Got my second laptop at 14; a HP Pavillion g6. Saw a documentary narrated by Richard Hammond (yes, the guy from the old Top Gear), about how the new [Airbus A380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdOXYDZO2so&t=1116) uses composite materials to keep the weight low and be super strong at the same time.\n\n- After graduating from high school, I was finally able to study what I had been dreaming: Mechanical Engineering.\n\n- Designed, optimized, and manufactured 4 SAE level vehicles \u2013 three ATV\u2019s and one BAJA vehicle during undergraduate studies. Then, post-graduation went on to mentor the team for another year.\n\n- Got admitted to the best institute for Automotive Studies in the US; something that I had been looking forward to for a long time. And, got selected in Deep Orange, the flagship program of the automotive engineering department.\n\n# Me likey\n\n- Road Trips\n- Cooking\n- [Mellow music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A)\n- Coffee in rain\n- Gaming\n- Good Skies\n- Memes\n\n# I dream of\n\n- Always finding inspiration.\n- Enabling a brighter future.\n- Doing better.\n- Perfect CAD to real life transitions.\n\n# Fun stuff\n\n- Is there fun in mechanical engineering?\n",h=d.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,c=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(i.jsx)(o.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(i.jsx)(l.a,{title:"About",children:Object(i.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(i.jsx)("header",{children:Object(i.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(i.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(i.jsx)(o.b,{to:"/",children:"About Me"})}),Object(i.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),Object(i.jsx)(s.a,{source:d,renderers:{Link:c},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
