# Intro

Motivated automotive engineer with big picture focus, aspiring to enhance my portfolio by working with major teams and vehicle manufacturing units throughout the United States. Proven skills in CAE, Design and Advanced materials with hands-on experience in performing set-up and interpretation of FEA analysis for Static/Dynamic, Linear/Non-linear, Crash, Modal, Thermal, and fatigue analysis load cases in commercial software packages like Hyperworks, Ansys. Strong experience with Solidworks and Siemens NX for CAD, and 3D Printing for rapid prototyping applications.

# Currently

At [DeepOrange 12](https://cuicardeeporange.com/project/deep-orange-12/), I am interning as a Manufacturing Integrator. My work mainly deals with prototyping of the CAD models the CAD engineers generate using 3D printing. I also assist the CAD engineers when it comes to DF<sub>x</sub> (manufacturing/assembly/cost) and CAE. I also handle the material & manufacturing process selection for the said parts. Finally, I have also used my knowledge of 80-20 aluminum rails to design, optimize and build a structure house all the electronic components within their thermal and NVH constraints.

# My Story

- My parents got my first bicycle when I was 3 years old (circa. 1999) and thus began my love for <em>things that move</em>.

- My love for cars came from age 6, when my dad <em>finally</em> got a laptop for the home. It was an old Compaq laptop from his then workplace; but it was something. I still remember playing endless hours of [Need for Speed - Hot Pursuit 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Hot_Pursuit_2) and [Porsche Unleashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Porsche_Unleashed) on it until the game discs literally burned out.

- Moving to elementary school, I always made it a point to disassemble any mechanical pencil that I used to get, only to fail in putting it back together, which resulted in a good scolding at home. But that never deterred my inquisitive nature.

- I took a trip to Singapore in 2004 which was my first and till date favorite international destination. This is where I fell in love with [Pokemon games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_FireRed_and_LeafGreen) on the Gameboy Advance.

- Ages 8-15 were very busy. Started many activities to see which would stick around long enough to turn into hobbies; none did.

- Got my second laptop at 14; a HP Pavillion g6. Saw a documentary narrated by Richard Hammond (yes, the guy from the old Top Gear), about how the new [Airbus A380](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdOXYDZO2so&t=1116) uses composite materials to keep the weight low and be super strong at the same time.

- After graduating from high school, I was finally able to study what I had been dreaming: Mechanical Engineering.

- Designed, optimized, and manufactured 4 SAE level vehicles – three ATV’s and one BAJA vehicle during undergraduate studies. Then, post-graduation went on to mentor the team for another year.

- Got admitted to the best institute for Automotive Studies in the US; something that I had been looking forward to for a long time. And, got selected in Deep Orange, the flagship program of the automotive engineering department.
